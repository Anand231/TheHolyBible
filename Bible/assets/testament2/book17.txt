<book name="Titus">
			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</verse>
				<verse number="2">in hope of eternal life, which God, who can't lie, promised before eternal times;</verse>
				<verse number="3">but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God, our Savior;</verse>
				<verse number="4">to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God, the Father, and the Lord, Jesus Christ, our Savior.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;</verse>
				<verse number="6">if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.</verse>
				<verse number="7">For the overseer must be blameless, as God's steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;</verse>
				<verse number="8">but given to hospitality, as a lover of good, sober-minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;</verse>
				<verse number="9">holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.</verse>
				<verse number="10">For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,</verse>
				<verse number="11">whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake.</verse>
				<verse number="12">One of them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons."</verse>
				<verse number="13">This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
				<verse number="14">not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</verse>
				<verse number="15">To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">But say the things which fit the sound doctrine,</verse>
				<verse number="2">that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience:</verse>
				<verse number="3">and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;</verse>
				<verse number="4">that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
				<verse number="5">to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God's word may not be blasphemed.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober-minded;</verse>
				<verse number="7">in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,</verse>
				<verse number="8">and soundness of speech that can't be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;</verse>
				<verse number="10">not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.</verse>
				<verse number="11">For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,</verse>
				<verse number="12">instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;</verse>
				<verse number="13">looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior, Jesus Christ;</verse>
				<verse number="14">who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to every good work,</verse>
				<verse number="2">to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all gentleness toward all men.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</verse>
				<verse number="4">But when the kindness of God, our Savior, and his love toward man, appeared,</verse>
				<verse number="5">not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,</verse>
				<verse number="6">which he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ, our Savior;</verse>
				<verse number="7">that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
				<verse number="8">This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;</verse>
				<verse number="9">but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;</verse>
				<verse number="11">knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.</verse>
				<verse number="12">When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing may be lacking for them.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</verse>
				<verse number="15">All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
