			<chapter number="1">
				<verse number="1">Blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the way of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</verse>
				<verse number="2">But his delight is in the law of Yahweh; On his law he meditates day and night.</verse>
				<verse number="3">He shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</verse>
				<verse number="6">For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked shall perish. Psalm 2</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="2">
				<verse number="1">Why do the nations rage, And the peoples plot a vain thing?</verse>
				<verse number="2">The kings of the earth take a stand, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Yahweh, and against his anointed, saying,</verse>
				<verse number="3">"Let us break their bonds apart, And cast away their cords from us."</verse>
				<verse number="4">He who sits in the heavens will laugh. The Lord will have them in derision.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Then he will speak to them in his anger, And terrify them in his wrath:</verse>
				<verse number="6">"Yet I have set my king on my holy hill of Zion."</verse>
				<verse number="7">I will tell of the decree. Yahweh said to me, "You are my son. Today I have become your father.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, The uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.</verse>
				<verse number="9">You shall break them with a rod of iron. You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."</verse>
				<verse number="10">Now therefore be wise, you kings. Be instructed, you judges of the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="11">Serve Yahweh with fear, And rejoice with trembling.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him. Psalm 3 A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom, his son.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="3">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased! Many are those who rise up against me.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Many there are who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, My glory, and the one who lifts up my head.</verse>
				<verse number="4">I cry to Yahweh with my voice, And he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I laid myself down and slept. I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people Who have set themselves against me on every side.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Arise, Yahweh! Save me, my God! For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Salvation belongs to Yahweh. Your blessing be on your people. Selah. Psalm 4 For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm by David.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="4">
				<verse number="1">Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness. Give me relief from my distress. Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="2">You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah.</verse>
				<verse number="3">But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly: Yahweh will hear when I call to him.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Stand in awe, and don't sin. Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. Put your trust in Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Many say, "Who will show us any good?" Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.</verse>
				<verse number="7">You have put gladness in my heart, More than when their grain and their new wine are increased.</verse>
				<verse number="8">In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, For you, Yahweh alone, make me live in safety. Psalm 5 For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by David.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="5">
				<verse number="1">Give ear to my words, Yahweh. Consider my meditation.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Listen to the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; For to you do I pray.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh, in the morning shall you hear my voice. In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness. Evil can't live with you.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The arrogant shall not stand in your sight. You hate all workers of iniquity.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You will destroy those who speak lies. Yahweh abhors the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But as for me, in the abundance of your lovingkindness I will come into your house: I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies. Make your way straight before my face.</verse>
				<verse number="9">For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their inward part is destruction. Their throat is an open tomb. They flatter with their tongue.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Hold them guilty, God. Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions, For they have rebelled against you.</verse>
				<verse number="11">But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice, Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.</verse>
				<verse number="12">For you will bless the righteous. Yahweh, you will surround him with favor as with a shield. Psalm 6 For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, upon the eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm by David.</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="6">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your anger, Neither discipline me in your wrath.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint. Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled.</verse>
				<verse number="3">My soul is also in great anguish. But you, Yahweh -- how long?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul, And save me for your lovingkindness' sake.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For in death there is no memory of you. In Sheol, who shall give you thanks?</verse>
				<verse number="6">I am weary with my groaning; Every night I flood my bed; I drench my couch with my tears.</verse>
				<verse number="7">My eye wastes away because of grief; It grows old because of all my adversaries.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, For Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Yahweh has heard my supplication. Yahweh will receive my prayer.</verse>
				<verse number="10">May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly. Psalm 7 A meditation by David, which he sang to Yahweh, concerning the words of Cush, the Benjamite.</verse>

			<chapter number="7">
				<verse number="1">Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you. Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,</verse>
				<verse number="2">Lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</verse>
				<verse number="3">Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, If there is iniquity in my hands,</verse>
				<verse number="4">If I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (Yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),</verse>
				<verse number="5">Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; Yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, And lay my glory in the dust. Selah.</verse>
				<verse number="6">Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. Rule over them on high.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness, And to my integrity that is in me.</verse>
				<verse number="9">Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, But establish the righteous; Their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.</verse>
				<verse number="10">My shield is with God, Who saves the upright in heart.</verse>
				<verse number="11">God is a righteous judge, Yes, a God who has indignation every day.</verse>
				<verse number="12">If a man doesn't relent, he will sharpen his sword; He has bent and strung his bow.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. He makes ready his flaming arrows.</verse>
				<verse number="14">Behold, he travails with iniquity; Yes, he has conceived mischief and brought forth falsehood.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He has dug a hole, And has fallen into the pit which he made.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.</verse>
				<verse number="17">I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness, And will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High. Psalm 8 For the Chief Musician; on an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by David.</verse>

				<verse number="1">Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth, Who has set your glory above the heavens!</verse>
				<verse number="2">From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength, Because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, The moon and the stars, which you have ordained;</verse>
				<verse number="4">What is man, that you think of him? The son of man, that you care for him?</verse>
				<verse number="5">For you have made him a little lower than the angels, And crowned him with glory and honor.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You make him ruler over the works of your hands. You have put all things under his feet:</verse>
				<verse number="7">All sheep and oxen, Yes, and the animals of the field,</verse>
				<verse number="8">The birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, And whatever passes through the paths of the seas.</verse>

				<verse number="2">I will be glad and rejoice in you. I will sing praise to your name, you Most High.</verse>
				<verse number="3">When my enemies turn back, They stumble and perish in your presence.</verse>
				<verse number="4">For you have maintained my right and my cause. You sit on the throne judging righteously.</verse>
				<verse number="5">You have rebuked the nations. You have destroyed the wicked. You have blotted out their name forever and ever.</verse>
				<verse number="6">The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin. The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.</verse>
				<verse number="7">But Yahweh reigns forever. He has prepared his throne for judgment.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He will judge the world in righteousness. He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.</verse>

				<verse number="14">That I may show forth all your praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in your salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="15">The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made; In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.</verse>

			</chapter>
			<chapter number="10">
				<verse number="1">Why do you stand far off, Yahweh? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?</verse>
				<verse number="2">In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak; They are caught in the schemes that they devise.</verse>
				<verse number="3">For the wicked boasts of his heart's cravings, He blesses the greedy, and condemns Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The wicked, in the pride of his face, Has no room in his thoughts for God.</verse>
				<verse number="5">His ways are prosperous at all times; He is haughty, and your laws are far from his sight: As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.</verse>
				<verse number="6">He says in his heart, "I shall not be shaken; For generations I shall have no trouble."</verse>
				<verse number="7">His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.</verse>
				<verse number="8">He lies in wait near the villages. From ambushes, he murders the innocent. His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush. He lies in wait to catch the helpless. He catches the helpless, when he draws him in his net.</verse>
				<verse number="10">The helpless are crushed, they collapse, They fall under his strength.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He says in his heart, "God has forgotten. He hides his face. He will never see it."</verse>
				<verse number="12">Arise, Yahweh! God, lift up your hand! Don't forget the helpless.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Why does the wicked condemn God, And say in his heart, "God won't call me into account?"</verse>
				<verse number="14">But you do see trouble and grief; You consider it to take it into your hand. You help the victim and the fatherless.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Break the arm of the wicked. As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.</verse>
				<verse number="16">Yahweh is King forever and ever! The nations will perish out of his land.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble. You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to hear,</verse>

			</chapter>
			<chapter number="11">
				<verse number="1">In Yahweh do I take refuge. How can you say to my soul, "Flee as a bird to your mountain!"</verse>
				<verse number="2">For, behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrows on the strings, That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.</verse>
				<verse number="3">If the foundations are destroyed, What can the righteous do?</verse>
				<verse number="4">Yahweh is in his holy temple. Yahweh is on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men.</verse>
				<verse number="5">Yahweh examines the righteous, But the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates.</verse>
				<verse number="6">On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; Fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.</verse>

			</chapter>
			<chapter number="12">
				<verse number="1">Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases. For the faithful fail from among the children of men.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Everyone lies to his neighbor. With flattering lips, and with a double heart, do they speak.</verse>
				<verse number="3">May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, And the tongue that boasts,</verse>
				<verse number="4">Who have said, "With our tongue will we prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?"</verse>
				<verse number="5">"Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy, I will now arise," says Yahweh; "I will set him in safety from those who malign him."</verse>

			</chapter>
			<chapter number="14">
				<verse number="1">The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they have done abominable works. There is none who does good.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men, To see if there were any who did understand, Who did seek after God.</verse>
				<verse number="3">They have all gone aside; they have together become corrupt. There is none who does good, no, not one.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And don't call on Yahweh?</verse>
				<verse number="5">There were they in great fear, For God is in the generation of the righteous.</verse>
				<verse number="6">You put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Yahweh is his refuge.</verse>

				<verse number="1">Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary? Who shall live on your holy hill?</verse>

				<verse number="3">As for the saints who are in the earth, They are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.</verse>

			<chapter number="17">
				<verse number="1">Hear, Yahweh, my righteous plea; Give ear to my prayer, that doesn't go out of deceitful lips.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Let my sentence come forth from your presence; Let your eyes look on equity.</verse>
				<verse number="3">You have proved my heart; you have visited me in the night; You have tried me, and found nothing; I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.</verse>
				<verse number="4">As for the works of men, by the word of your lips I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.</verse>
				<verse number="5">My steps have held fast to your paths, My feet have not slipped.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I have called on you, for you will answer me, God: Turn your ear to me. Hear my speech.</verse>

				<verse number="10">They close up their callous hearts. With their mouth they speak proudly.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They have now surrounded us in our steps. They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.</verse>
				<verse number="12">He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, As it were a young lion lurking in secret places.</verse>

By David, the servant of Yahweh, who spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said,</verse>
			</chapter>
			<chapter number="18">
				<verse number="1">I love you, Yahweh, my strength.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Yahweh is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised; So shall I be saved from my enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="4">The cords of death surrounded me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.</verse>
				<verse number="5">The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came on me.</verse>
				<verse number="6">In my distress I called on Yahweh, And cried to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple, My cry before him came into his ears.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken, Because he was angry.</verse>
				<verse number="8">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, Fire out of his mouth devoured; Coals were kindled by it.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under his feet.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.</verse>
				<verse number="11">He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion around him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</verse>
				<verse number="12">At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, Hailstones and coals of fire.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Yahweh also thundered in the sky, The Most High uttered his voice, Hailstones and coals of fire.</verse>
				<verse number="14">He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yes, lightnings manifold, and routed them.</verse>
				<verse number="15">Then the channels of waters appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, At your rebuke, Yahweh, At the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He sent from on high. He took me. He drew me out of many waters.</verse>
				<verse number="17">He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They came on me in the day of my calamity, But Yahweh was my support.</verse>
				<verse number="19">He brought me forth also into a large place. He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.</verse>
				<verse number="21">For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, And have not wickedly departed from my God.</verse>
				<verse number="22">For all his ordinances were before me. I didn't put away his statutes from me.</verse>
				<verse number="23">I was also blameless with him. I kept myself from my iniquity.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Therefore has Yahweh recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</verse>
				<verse number="25">With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.</verse>
				<verse number="26">With the pure, you will show yourself pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.</verse>
				<verse number="27">For you will save the afflicted people, But the haughty eyes you will bring down.</verse>
				<verse number="28">For you will light my lamp. Yahweh, my God, will light up my darkness.</verse>
				<verse number="29">For by you, I advance through a troop. By my God, I leap over a wall.</verse>
				<verse number="30">As for God, his way is perfect. The word of Yahweh is tried. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</verse>
				<verse number="31">For who is God, except Yahweh? Who is a rock, besides our God,</verse>
				<verse number="32">The God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?</verse>
				<verse number="33">He makes my feet like hinds' feet, And sets me on my high places.</verse>
				<verse number="34">He teaches my hands to war; So that my arms bend a bow of bronze.</verse>
				<verse number="35">You have also given me the shield of your salvation. Your right hand sustains me. Your gentleness has made me great.</verse>
				<verse number="36">You have enlarged my steps under me, My feet have not slipped.</verse>
				<verse number="37">I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them. Neither will I turn again until they are consumed.</verse>
				<verse number="38">I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise. They shall fall under my feet.</verse>
				<verse number="39">For you have girded me with strength to the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</verse>
				<verse number="40">You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, That I might cut off those who hate me.</verse>
				<verse number="41">They cried, but there was none to save; Even to Yahweh, but he didn't answer them.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind. I cast them out as the mire of the streets.</verse>
				<verse number="43">You have delivered me from the strivings of the people. You have made me the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</verse>
				<verse number="44">As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me. The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.</verse>
				<verse number="45">The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places.</verse>
				<verse number="46">Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock. Exalted be the God of my salvation,</verse>
				<verse number="47">Even the God who executes vengeance for me, And subdues peoples under me.</verse>

				<verse number="1">My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God for help, And for him to listen to me.</verse>
				<verse number="2">In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord. My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn't get tired. My soul refused to be comforted.</verse>
				<verse number="3">I remember God, and I groan. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.</verse>
				<verse number="4">You hold my eyelids open. I am so troubled that I can't speak.</verse>
				<verse number="5">I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times.</verse>
				<verse number="6">I remember my song in the night. I consider in my own heart; My spirit diligently inquires:</verse>
				<verse number="7">"Will the Lord reject us forever? Will he be favorable no more?</verse>
				<verse number="8">Has his lovingkindness vanished forever? Does his promise fail for generations?</verse>
				<verse number="9">Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?" Selah.</verse>
				<verse number="10">Then I thought, "I will appeal to this: The years of the right hand of the Most High."</verse>
				<verse number="11">I will remember Yah's deeds; For I will remember your wonders of old.</verse>
				<verse number="12">I will also meditate on all your work, And consider your doings.</verse>
				<verse number="13">Your way, God, is in the sanctuary. What god is great like God?</verse>
				<verse number="14">You are the God who does wonders. You have made your strength known among the peoples.</verse>
				<verse number="15">You have redeemed your people with your arm, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.</verse>
				<verse number="16">The waters saw you, God. The waters saw you, and they writhed. The depths also convulsed.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The clouds poured out water. The skies resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed around.</verse>
				<verse number="18">The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Your way was through the sea; Your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.</verse>

			</chapter>
			<chapter number="78">
				<verse number="1">Hear my law, my people. Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.</verse>
				<verse number="2">I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old,</verse>
				<verse number="3">Which we have heard and known, Our fathers have told us.</verse>
				<verse number="4">We will not hide them from their children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, His strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.</verse>
				<verse number="5">For he established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children;</verse>
				<verse number="6">That the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; Who should arise and tell their children,</verse>
				<verse number="7">That they might set their hope in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep his commandments,</verse>
				<verse number="8">And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that didn't make their hearts loyal, Whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</verse>
				<verse number="9">The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle.</verse>
				<verse number="10">They didn't keep the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law.</verse>
				<verse number="11">They forgot his doings, His wondrous works that he had showed them.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</verse>
				<verse number="13">He split the sea, and caused them to pass through; He made the waters stand as a heap.</verse>
				<verse number="14">In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, All the night with a light of fire.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He split rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</verse>
				<verse number="16">He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers.</verse>
				<verse number="17">Yet they still went on to sin against him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.</verse>
				<verse number="18">They tempted God in their heart By asking food according to their desire.</verse>
				<verse number="19">Yes, they spoke against God. They said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</verse>
				<verse number="20">Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, Streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?"</verse>
				<verse number="21">Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacob, Anger also went up against Israel,</verse>
				<verse number="22">Because they didn't believe in God, And didn't trust in his salvation.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Yet he commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven.</verse>
				<verse number="24">He rained down manna on them to eat, And gave them food from the sky.</verse>
				<verse number="25">Man ate the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full.</verse>
				<verse number="26">He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. By his power he guided the south wind.</verse>
				<verse number="27">He rained also flesh on them as the dust; Winged birds as the sand of the seas.</verse>
				<verse number="28">He let them fall in the midst of their camp, Around their habitations.</verse>
				<verse number="29">So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire.</verse>
				<verse number="30">They didn't turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths,</verse>
				<verse number="31">When the anger of God went up against them, And killed some of the fattest of them, And struck down the young men of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="32">For all this they still sinned, And didn't believe in his wondrous works.</verse>
				<verse number="33">Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, And their years in terror.</verse>
				<verse number="34">When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They returned and sought God earnestly.</verse>
				<verse number="35">They remembered that God was their rock, The Most High God their redeemer.</verse>
				<verse number="36">But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied to him with their tongue.</verse>
				<verse number="37">For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant.</verse>
				<verse number="38">But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, And didn't stir up all his wrath.</verse>
				<verse number="39">He remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passes away, and doesn't come again.</verse>
				<verse number="40">How often did they rebel against him in the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert!</verse>
				<verse number="41">They turned again and tempted God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
				<verse number="42">They didn't remember his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</verse>
				<verse number="43">How he set his signs in Egypt, His wonders in the field of Zoan,</verse>
				<verse number="44">Turned their rivers into blood, Their streams, so that they could not drink.</verse>
				<verse number="45">He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; Frogs, which destroyed them.</verse>
				<verse number="46">He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, Their labor to the locust.</verse>
				<verse number="47">He destroyed their vines with hail, Their sycamore-fig trees with frost.</verse>
				<verse number="48">He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</verse>
				<verse number="49">He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, indignation, and trouble, And a band of angels of evil.</verse>
				<verse number="50">He made a path for his anger. He didn't spare their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence,</verse>
				<verse number="51">And struck all the firstborn in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</verse>
				<verse number="52">But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</verse>
				<verse number="53">He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid, But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</verse>
				<verse number="54">He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had taken.</verse>
				<verse number="55">He also drove out the nations before them, Allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</verse>
				<verse number="56">Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And didn't keep his testimonies;</verse>
				<verse number="57">But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</verse>
				<verse number="58">For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.</verse>
				<verse number="59">When God heard this, he was angry, And greatly abhorred Israel;</verse>
				<verse number="60">So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men;</verse>
				<verse number="61">And delivered his strength into captivity, His glory into the adversary's hand.</verse>
				<verse number="62">He also gave his people over to the sword, And was angry with his inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="63">Fire devoured their young men; Their virgins had no wedding song.</verse>
				<verse number="64">Their priests fell by the sword; Their widows made no lamentation.</verse>
				<verse number="65">Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, Like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</verse>
				<verse number="66">He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.</verse>
				<verse number="67">Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, And didn't choose the tribe of Ephraim,</verse>
				<verse number="68">But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.</verse>
				<verse number="69">He built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he has established forever.</verse>
				<verse number="70">He also chose David his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds;</verse>
				<verse number="71">From following the ewes that have their young he brought him To be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="72">So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands. Psalm 79 A Psalm by Asaph.</verse>

				<verse number="16">He called for a famine on the land. He destroyed the food supplies.</verse>

				<verse number="21">He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all of his possessions;</verse>
				<verse number="22">To discipline his princes at his pleasure, And to teach his elders wisdom.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Israel also came into Egypt. Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</verse>
				<verse number="24">He increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries.</verse>
				<verse number="25">He turned their heart to hate his people, To conspire against his servants.</verse>
				<verse number="26">He sent Moses, his servant, And Aaron, whom he had chosen.</verse>

			<chapter number="106">
				<verse number="1">Praise Yahweh! Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, For his lovingkindness endures forever.</verse>
				<verse number="2">Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, Or fully declare all his praise?</verse>
				<verse number="3">Blessed are those who keep justice, He who does righteousness at all times.</verse>
				<verse number="4">Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people. Visit me with your salvation,</verse>
				<verse number="5">That I may see the prosperity of your chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, That I may glory with your inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="6">We have sinned with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.</verse>
				<verse number="7">Our fathers didn't understand your wonders in Egypt. They didn't remember the multitude of your lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</verse>
				<verse number="8">Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, That he might make his mighty power known.</verse>
				<verse number="9">He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; So he led them through the depths, as through a desert.</verse>
				<verse number="10">He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</verse>
				<verse number="11">The waters covered their adversaries. There was not one of them left.</verse>
				<verse number="12">Then they believed his words. They sang his praise.</verse>
				<verse number="13">They soon forgot his works. They didn't wait for his counsel,</verse>
				<verse number="14">But gave in to craving in the desert, And tested God in the wasteland.</verse>
				<verse number="15">He gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul.</verse>
				<verse number="16">They envied Moses also in the camp, And Aaron, Yahweh's saint.</verse>
				<verse number="17">The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram.</verse>
				<verse number="18">A fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked.</verse>
				<verse number="19">They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image.</verse>
				<verse number="20">Thus they exchanged their glory For an image of a bull that eats grass.</verse>
				<verse number="21">They forgot God, their Savior, Who had done great things in Egypt,</verse>
				<verse number="22">Wondrous works in the land of Ham, And awesome things by the Red Sea.</verse>
				<verse number="23">Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn't destroy them.</verse>
				<verse number="24">Yes, they despised the pleasant land. They didn't believe his word,</verse>
				<verse number="25">But murmured in their tents, And didn't listen to the voice of Yahweh.</verse>
				<verse number="26">Therefore he swore to them That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</verse>
				<verse number="27">That he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.</verse>
				<verse number="28">They joined themselves also to Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.</verse>
				<verse number="29">Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. The plague broke in on them.</verse>
				<verse number="30">Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, So the plague was stopped.</verse>
				<verse number="31">That was credited to him for righteousness, To all generations forevermore.</verse>
				<verse number="32">They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that Moses was troubled for their sakes;</verse>
				<verse number="33">Because they were rebellious against his spirit, He spoke rashly with his lips.</verse>
				<verse number="34">They didn't destroy the peoples, As Yahweh commanded them,</verse>
				<verse number="35">But mingled themselves with the nations, Learned their works.</verse>
				<verse number="36">They served their idols, Which became a snare to them.</verse>
				<verse number="37">Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</verse>
				<verse number="38">They shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted with blood.</verse>
				<verse number="39">Thus were they defiled with their works, And prostituted themselves in their deeds.</verse>
				<verse number="40">Therefore the wrath of Yahweh was kindled against his people. He abhorred his inheritance.</verse>
				<verse number="41">He gave them into the hand of the nations. Those who hated them ruled over them.</verse>
				<verse number="42">Their enemies also oppressed them. They were brought into subjection under their hand.</verse>
				<verse number="43">Many times he delivered them, But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity.</verse>
				<verse number="44">Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry.</verse>
				<verse number="45">He remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</verse>
				<verse number="46">He made them also to be pitied By all those who carried them captive.</verse>
				<verse number="47">Save us, Yahweh, our God, Gather us from among the nations, To give thanks to your holy name, To triumph in your praise!</verse>

				<verse number="26">They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths. Their soul melts away because of trouble.</verse>
				<verse number="27">They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits' end.</verse>
				<verse number="28">Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, He brings them out of their distress.</verse>
				<verse number="29">He makes the storm a calm, So that its waves are still.</verse>

				<verse number="33">He turns rivers into a desert, Water springs into a thirsty ground,</verse>
				<verse number="34">And a fruitful land into a salt waste, For the wickedness of those who dwell in it.</verse>
				<verse number="35">He turns a desert into a pool of water, And a dry land into water springs.</verse>
				<verse number="36">There he makes the hungry to live, That they may prepare a city to live in,</verse>
				<verse number="37">Sow fields, plant vineyards, And reap the fruits of increase.</verse>
